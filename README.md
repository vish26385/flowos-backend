# FlowOS Backend

⚙️ **FlowOS Backend** is the API service powering FlowOS Mobile.  
It is built with **ASP.NET Core 8 (C#)** and provides secure REST APIs for the FlowOS ecosystem.

## 🌍 Vision
FlowOS Backend is the **foundation** that enables AI-powered planning, nudges, and habit tracking.  
It ensures that user data, tasks, and plans are stored, processed, and delivered reliably.  

The backend is designed to be **scalable, secure, and extensible** — supporting both the MVP and future integrations.
